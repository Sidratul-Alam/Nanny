# Nanny
Life is getting busy and people are getting involved online nowadays. The use of the internet is  also increasing rapidly in the present world like Bangladesh. Besides, the family is getting atomic  with time. So, our new parents or mothers are not getting anyone besides them to take care of  their baby since they are not expert or educated to nourish the child. In the early decades,  grandmothers (Grandma) would help them to take care of them and they also shared their  experience to foster a child. But the new parents or mothers don’t get beside them since they  cannot live together right now due to business. From that perspective, to solve the problem, the  project is designed. The project aims to connect all the mothers and grandmothers in a single  platform so that new mothers can share their child’s problems and others can help them to foster  the child by giving solutions. The system will collect the child's age and information and based  on age others will help the new mother. The system will collect detailed information while  registration is completed and stored in the database for further assistance
